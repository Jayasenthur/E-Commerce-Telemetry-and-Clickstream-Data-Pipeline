# From Clicks to Deliveries: Maximizing E-commerce Performance with Real-Time Data Integration

This project implements a real-time data pipeline for processing __Clickstream Data__ and __Truck Telemetry Data__ using AWS services (Kinesis, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Firehose) and Snowflake for data storage and analysis. The data is visualized using a __Streamlit UI__.

# Technologies Used
* __AWS Services:__
     * __Kinesis Data Streams__: For real-time data ingestion.
     * __Lambda Functions__: For data processing.
     * __DynamoDB__: For storing Clickstream data
     * __S3__ : For storing Truck Telemetry data.
     * __Firehose__: For loading data from Kinesis to S3.
     * __API Gateway__: For exposing the Truck Telemetry API.
* __Snowflake__: For data warehousing and analysis.
* __Streamlit__: For data visualization.
* __Python__: For scripting and data generation.
